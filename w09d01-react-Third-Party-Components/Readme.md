## Overview

## React UI components libraries

React is probably one of the best choices for building UI. Good design, support and community. However, there are cases where we want to use an external service or we want to integrate something completely different. We all know that React works heavily with the actual DOM and basically controls what’s rendered on the screen. That’s why integrating of third-party components could be tricky. 

We will learn about some useful React Component libraries

### 1. React Material-UI 

React Material-UI is a set of React components that implements Google’s Material Design. It is probably the most popular React component library.

### 3. React toolbox

React Toolbox is a set of React components that implements Google Material Design specification. It’s built on top of some the trendiest proposals like CSS Modules (written in SASS), Webpack and ES6. The library’s website provides a live component playground.

### 4. React Belle

React Belle is a set of React components optimized to work both on mobile & desktop devices. The styles are highly customizable so you can configure the base styles of all the components as well as modify each one of them individually. Here is also a [nice example](http://gideonshils.com/Belle-With-Bit/).
